ACTION: DESIGN_SYSTEM_COMPONENTS

STEP 1: ANALYZE_REQUIREMENTS

- READ design tokens from resources/design/<module>.json
- IDENTIFY primary UI elements (buttons, inputs, alerts, modals, etc.)
- DETERMINE variants and states (hover, focus, disabled, etc.)

STEP 2: IMPLEMENT_COMPONENTS

- CREATE Blade component stubs in resources/views/components/<module>/
- CREATE Vue components in resources/js/components/<module>/
- FOLLOW Tailwind utility-first styling and semantic markup
- DOCUMENT props via JSDoc (Vue) or PHPDoc (Blade)

STEP 3: DOCUMENTATION_AND_USAGE

- GENERATE usage examples in stories or MD files
- INCLUDE all expected variants in stories or preview pages
- VALIDATE accessibility (a11y) for each component

EXPECTED_OUTPUT:

A complete and documented base Design System for <module>, with consistent naming, reusability, and accessible implementation in Vue and Blade.

AVOID inconsistent naming, excessive abstractions, or framework-specific hacks.
